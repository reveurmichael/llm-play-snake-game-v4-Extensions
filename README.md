### **Perfect Foundation (Task0)**

- **Template Method Pattern**: Enables 80-95% code reduction in extensions
- **Factory Pattern Excellence**: Canonical `create()` method implementation
- **SSOT Implementation**: Single source of truth eliminating duplication
- **Multi-Interface Support**: PyGame, Web, CLI, Streamlit options

- **Streamlit Apps**: Professional analysis and file management tools
- **Extensions/Common**: Perfect shared utilities with SSOT compliance

### **Two-LLM Architecture (MoE Approach)**

Task0 implements a Mixture-of-Experts inspired approach where two specialized LLMs work together:

1. **Primary LLM (Game Strategy Expert)**
   - Takes the game state as input
   - Analyzes the Snake's position, apple location, and available moves
   - Generates a logical plan to navigate toward the apple
   - May or may not generate properly structured output

2. **Secondary LLM (Formatting Expert)**
   - Takes the primary LLM's output as input
   - Specializes in parsing and formatting the response
   - Ensures the final output follows the required JSON format
   - Acts as a guarantor of response quality
   - Can be disabled with `--parser-provider none` to use primary LLM output directly

## Command Line Arguments

- `--provider`: LLM provider for the primary LLM (hunyuan, ollama, deepseek, or mistral)
- `--model`: Model name for the primary LLM
- `--parser-provider`: LLM provider for the secondary LLM (defaults to primary provider if not specified). Use "none" to skip using a parser.
- `--parser-model`: Model name for the secondary LLM
- `--max-games`: Maximum number of games to play
- `--pause-between-moves`: Pause between sequential moves in seconds
- `--max-steps`: Maximum steps a snake can take in a single game (default: 400)
- `--sleep-before-launching`: Time to sleep (in minutes) before launching the program
- `--max-empty-moves`: Maximum consecutive empty moves before game over
- `--no-gui`: Run without the graphical interface (text-only mode)
- `--log-dir`: Directory to store log files

## Project Structure

The codebase is organized in a modular structure to ensure maintainability and separation of concerns:

- `/core`: Core game engine components
- `/gui`: Graphical user interface components
- `/llm`: Language model integration  
- `/utils`: Utility modules  
- `/replay`: Replay functionality
- `/web`: Web version of the Snake game
  
- Main modules:
  - `main.py`: Entry point with command-line argument parsing
  - `config.py`: Configuration constants
  - `app.py`: Streamlit dashboard for analyzing game statistics and replaying games
  - `replay.py`: Command-line interface for replaying saved games (pygame version)
  - `replay_web.py`: Command-line interface for replaying saved games (web version)
  - `human_play.py`: Human-playable version of the Snake game (pygame version)
  - `human_play_web.py`: Human-playable version of the Snake game (web version)

## Data Output

The system generates structured output for each game session:

- `game_N.json`: Contains complete data for game number N, including moves, statistics, and time metrics
- `summary.json`: Contains aggregated statistics for the entire session
- `prompts/`: Directory containing all prompts sent to the LLMs
- `responses/`: Directory containing all responses received from the LLMs

## Game Termination Conditions

The snake game will terminate under any of the following conditions:
1. Snake hits a wall (boundary of the game board)
2. Snake collides with its own body
3. Maximum steps limit is reached (default: 400 steps)
4. Three consecutive empty moves occur without ERROR
   - Empty moves are checked immediately when detected
   - An empty move occurs when the LLM returns `{"moves":[], "reasoning":"..."}`
   - If the reasoning contains "SOMETHING_IS_WRONG", the consecutive count is reset
5. A game error occurs
   - The system will catch errors, log them, and continue to the next game
   - Error information is saved in the game summary

After game termination (for any reason), the system will automatically start the next game until the maximum number of games is reached.

## How this Project Resembles a Real Research Project

- **Comprehensive Logging**: Extensive JSON file logging that tracks nearly everything, potentially useful for future analysis
- **Multiple Execution Modes**: Supports both visual and non-visual (headless) modes
- **Replay Functionality**: Enables result verification and analysis
- **Analysis Dashboard**: Includes tools for preliminary result analysis and experiment parameter adjustment
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Supports quick testing with minimal parameters:
  ```
  python main.py --provider ollama --model mistral:7b --parser-provider ollama --parser-model mistral:7b --max-games 1 --no-gui --sleep-before-launching 1 --max-steps 3 --max-consecutive-something-is-wrong-allowed 0
  ```

## What's Missing for a Complete Research Project

- **Automated Launch System**: More script-based and parallelized application launching instead of command-line arguments
- **Resource Management**: Helper scripts for GPU usage monitoring and application launch coordination
- **Logging System**: Implementation of standard logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
- **Data Analysis Pipeline**: Comprehensive data processing and analysis tools (for reporting and paper publication)

## If You Want to Change the Code

As a fundamental rule, the schema of our `game_N.json` and `summary.json` files is now fixed and should never be modified. You can, on the contrary, modify the code to change how those values are calculated.
